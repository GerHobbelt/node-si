Node Si
=========

The goal of this project is to provide a simple module that parses and formats
numbers to be human readable - like "10gb" -> 1e10.

This might be especially useful in command line arguments and configuration 
directives where you don't want the user to pass the whole number or use the 
scientific notation.

Usage
-------

Write a simple code, like:

    var si = require('si'),
        number = si.parse(process.argv[2]);
        
    console.log('Your number is: ', 
                    number);
    console.log('The square of it is: ', 
                    si.format(Math.pow(number, 2)));
    console.log('The square root on the other hand is: ', 
                    si.format(Math.pow(number, 0.5)));

Now run it:

    $ node tests/basic.js 1G
    Your number is:  1000000000
    The square of it is:  1E
    The square root on the other hand is:  31.62k

Fairly straightforward I hope.

Future
--------

I will be bringing some more parsers/formatters in later releases, like:

* IEC compliant binary multipliers like "MiB"
* Case sensitive Mbytes/mbytes (decimal vs. binary)
* Fractional SI multipliers like centi/mili etc.

Feel free to post feature requests in issues. :)
